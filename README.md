I am a PHP Full-Stack Developer with 10+ years of professional experience in web development and e-commerce solutions.

As most of my professional projects were closed-source, I use this GitHub to showcase personal and open-source work while keeping my skills current in PHP 7/8, frameworks (Laravel, Symfony, Yii2), and JavaScript.
